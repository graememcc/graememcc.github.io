<p>I occasionally flirt with functional programming. Well to tell you the truth, its more of a vague attempt to repent for a misspent youth. After all, I studied at Glasgow: a university that happens to know a thing or two about putting a Haskell compiler together. It is to my eternal shame that I took just one course in functional programming, albeit supplemented by a later reacquaintance in a project involving SECD machines and <em>(shudders)</em> Java.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Javascript world has belatedly caught up to Mr Eich's incredible foresight in designing a language with first-class functions. Hey, we can—to an extent—program functionally too! Libraries like Underscore and LoDash have enjoyed a meteoric rise. However, as has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3svKOdZijA">noted</a> by wiser heads than I,  their APIs make composability harder due to the positioning of parameters. The preponderance of optional parameters and different signatures worries me too. Other libraries go some way to fixing that, but add currying and partial application as an afterthought, and frequently don't provide as full an API as Underscore and co., leaving you with an awful lot of scaffolding to build up before you can do anything useful.</p>

<p>This has left me reinventing some functional wheels once too often. But if there's one thing our Nodefathers have taught us, it's that the world can always use another Javascript library. So, with a certain inevitability, enter stage left <a href="https://graememcc.github.io/funkierJS">funkierJS</a>.</p>
