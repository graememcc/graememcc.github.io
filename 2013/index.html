  It started with the release of the new SimCity earlier this year. Sadly, I was only spectator: I doubted my machine could handle it - it's even starting to creak a bit when compiling Firefox (sad times). I settled for digging out my copy of SC4 and moving on. It continued with the growing drumbeat around the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Web as the platform</a>, including as a viable gaming platform. Another element was introduced when I read about a former Mozilla employee's work on <a href="http://vizicities.com/">ViziCities</a>. What happens when these swirl about in my head for a while?

  I searched Bugzilla last weekend. Nothing new there. I can't remember what this particular search entailed, but there amongst the results was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=819930" title="Bug 819930" target="_blank">bug 819930</a>, a Developer Tools bug about emulating CSS media types. It wasn't the bug I was looking for, though I did read it. I could see it would be a "nice to have" for web developers, but it simply wasn't an itch I needed to scratch. (My own CSS tweaking efforts tend to be reminiscent of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif" title="CSS gif" target="_blank">this gif</a>.)

  I spent a lazy Saturday evening reading. (Currently: <em>A Distant Mirror</em> by Barbara Tuchman, after listening to an awesome episode of <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh" title="Hardcore History" target="_blank">Hardcore History</a> on the Black Death.) At one point, I found myself distracted, pondering "print preview", which must render pages with <code>@media print</code> rules applied. Later still, another uninvited thought arrived about the <code>View-&gt;Page Style-&gt;No Style</code> menu item in Firefox. My fate was sealed.

  Those of you who hack on Gecko code will know that when changing an XPCOM interface, you need to update the IID. Now, in the dim fog of morning, when I haven't drunk enough coffee, how on earth am I supposed to remember that the command-line utility for <strong>UUID GEN</strong>eration is named <code>uuidgen</code>? I wish these things had useful mnemonics!
  </p>
  <p>
  Yes, I could pop in to irc.mozilla.org, and ask firebot. However, I would inevitably forget to /msg firebot, and it is well known that #developers is a hotbed of nefarious sorts, lying in wait to snatch your newly-minted IID and ride off into the sunset, cackling with glee. I could navigate to one of the many online tools, but, sheesh, that sure sounds like a lot of work, you know?
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>mach</code> to the rescue. I've landed a <code>mach uuid</code> command, which will furnish you with a UUID in canonical form. Alternatively, use <code>mach uuid -f cpp</code> for the C++ form.
  </p>
  <p>
  Happy IID revving!
