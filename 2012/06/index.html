  In the summer of 2011, the integration branch mozilla-inbound was created, to allow Mozilla contributors to land patches without having to wait multiple hours afterwards waiting for your builds to complete. A team of inbound-sheriffs monitor the tree, dealing with failures and backing out where appropriate. About once a day, one of the sheriffs would merge the changes to mozilla-central, and after the merge spend the next 90 minutes marking the bugs as resolved and pasting the pushlog URLs into each bug's comments. And thus your patch made it to mozilla-central!
  </p>
  <p>
  Wait a minute, after the merge the sheriffs did what?!?
  </p>
  <p>
  We have some smart people acting as inbound sheriffs. This does not seem like the best use of their time. It always bugged me, even though I've never merged myself. I wanted to do something about it. However, I felt it would be difficult to fully automate - even with our current restrictions, a wide variety of commit messages is possible. Accurately parsing them 100% of the time would be...hard. Throw in security bugs, and inbound's propensity to get so hosed that it has to be closed for a bit of "BACK OUT ALL THE THINGS!"...
  </p>
  <p>
  That said, I didn't think all was lost. As Kernighan and Plauger said, most users will be willing to meet you halfway, and be ecstatic if you manage 90% of the work.Â  I decided to see if we could get 90% of the way there.
